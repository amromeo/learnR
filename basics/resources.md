## R Resources

There are many many online and print resources for learning R. There are also many ways to learn R. The purpose here is just to link you to some of the ones that I have found useful.

### Google
Google is your friend. The use of R as a data analysis and programming language is explording. There are lots of people all over the world learning R right now. If you have a question, my first suggestion will be to google it. 

### Stack Overflow 
Stack Overflow bills itself as the 

> largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their programming and knowledge

Whatever questioned you googled, the first google hit was probably a Stack Overflow post.  Basically its a huge online message board for people learning things about computers. Most questions that people have about R get answered on this website. A user can post a question, and then some smart programmer type answers it. Thats ideally the way it works. Practically, the programmer will ask the questioner to be more precise, to provide an example of where they are having a problem. Eventually the problem gets answered and you can find it with google. You can post a question as well, but I've never stooped to that.


### R-Bloggers

You come across this website as you google. This is a site that aggregates other blogs, pulling together in one place a lot of different posts regarding R. I like it a lot, lots of good content for training and interesting analyses.


### Youtube videos

There are TONS of youtube videos which explain how to do things in R. Obviously these go into a bit more depth than the Stack Overflow questions. I like videos by a guy named Hadley Wickham. He's kind of the god of R right now.


### Online courses
Check the Rstudio website, https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/, which has some great online resources and courses. I actually started learning R by doing a coursera course, called the data science specialization in Coursera, by some statisticians from Johns Hopkins.

### Programs for R programming
There is actually a cool little program that is useful for learning R, its called Swirl. The packge runs in your Rstudio program. The swirl R package makes it fun and easy to learn R programming and data science. Go to http://swirlstats.com/ for instructions on how to download.


### Books
There are plenty of books about using R. Some are actually free and available online. I recommend http://r4ds.had.co.nz/.
